The app only accesses the API a minimal number of times. Therefore, Tesla's battery consumption will be kept to a minimum. Of course, your credentials and logs will not be sent to any server other than Tesla.

Have you ever been locked out of your Tesla because you left your iPhone or keys in the car? With this app, you can unlock your car from your Apple Watch in such a situation, making it very safe.

This app requires a Tesla account linked to a real Tesla car.
